Yes, this ACTUALLY reads your screen and asks chat GPT for the awnsers.
I would consider this not cheating because you are just using chat GPT as a search engine, so long as you are allowed it.
Of course, with great power comes great responibility. That is why I will not give instructions on how to run and use this. in order to run and use this code you must either:

1: Know/learn how to run python scrips and how to use both pytesseract and chat GPT in python. (I promise it is worth it though)

2: Get me (yes the creator of this code) to set this up for you. How would you do that? In person. Ask me in person. If you know me, great. If not, tough luck.
If your lucky you'll find a way to message me, and if you're really lucky I'll respond.
